## ðŸš¦ Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
None - M1.1 complete, ready for next tasks

### High Risk Items (Future)
1. **M7A: Custom Validation Research** (Month 8)
   - **Risk**: Rustler callback limitations may make this infeasible
   - **Mitigation**: Research phase first, alternative approaches documented

2. **M8: Advanced Features** (Month 11-13)  
   - **Risk**: WebAssembly support may not be possible with Rustler
   - **Mitigation**: Selective implementation based on feasibility

3. **M5-M6: Performance Features**
   - **Risk**: Concurrent validation may require significant Rust changes
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simpler parallel approaches

### Medium Risk Items
1. **M5: External References** - Network complexity and security
2. **M6: Performance** - Cache invalidation complexity  
3. **Integration Testing** - Ensuring all surfaces work together
