# ExJsonschema Comprehensive Upgrade Plan

This directory contains a complete plan for upgrading ExJsonschema from a basic JSON Schema validation library to a comprehensive, production-ready ecosystem that exposes the full capabilities of the underlying Rust `jsonschema` crate version 0.33.0.

## Plan Structure

### üìã Planning Documents
- **[00-overview.md](00-overview.md)** - High-level upgrade strategy and goals
- **[99-comprehensive-critique.md](99-comprehensive-critique.md)** - Critical analysis and recommendations

### üèóÔ∏è Functional Surfaces (Implementation Plans)

#### Phase 1: Essential Foundation
1. **[01-core-validation-engine.md](01-core-validation-engine.md)** - Enhanced validation with multiple output formats
2. **[02-configuration-options.md](02-configuration-options.md)** - Rich configuration and options system  
3. **[06-error-handling-output.md](06-error-handling-output.md)** - Advanced error reporting and formatting

#### Phase 2: High-Value Features
4. **[03-schema-drafts-meta-validation.md](03-schema-drafts-meta-validation.md)** - Multi-draft support and schema validation
5. **[04-external-references-resolution.md](04-external-references-resolution.md)** - Remote schema fetching and caching
6. **[07-performance-caching.md](07-performance-caching.md)** - Performance optimization and caching

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features  
7. **[05-custom-validation.md](05-custom-validation.md)** - Custom keywords and format validators
8. **[08-advanced-features.md](08-advanced-features.md)** - WebAssembly, async, and plugin architecture

## Current State vs. Target State

### Current Capabilities
- Basic schema compilation and validation
- Simple error reporting with path information
- Support for ~10% of underlying Rust crate features

### Target Capabilities
- **8 major functional surfaces** with comprehensive feature coverage
- **90%+ exposure** of Rust crate capabilities through idiomatic Elixir APIs
- **Production-ready** performance, caching, and monitoring
- **Extensible architecture** for custom validation and plugins

## Key Upgrade Benefits

### üöÄ Performance
- Advanced caching and optimization options
- Multiple regex engines for different performance profiles
- Concurrent validation support
- Comprehensive benchmarking tools

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer Experience
- Rich error reporting with suggestions and context
- Multiple output formats for different use cases
- Configuration profiles for common scenarios
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

### üè¢ Production Readiness
- External reference resolution with caching
- Schema registry patterns
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Security-focused design

### üîß Extensibility
- Custom validation keywords and formats
- Plugin architecture for advanced use cases
- Schema composition and reuse utilities
- Integration with other validation systems

## Implementation Approach

### Incremental Development
- Each surface can be implemented independently
- Backward compatibility maintained throughout
- Progressive enhancement of capabilities

### Risk Management
- High-risk features identified and researched early
- Fallback plans for complex technical challenges
- Comprehensive testing at each phase

### Community Engagement
- Early feedback collection on API designs
- Documentation-driven development
- Open source contribution opportunities

## Getting Started

1. **Review the critique**: Read [99-comprehensive-critique.md](99-comprehensive-critique.md) for detailed analysis
2. **Check the roadmap**: See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for milestones and timeline
3. **Understand testing**: Review [TESTING_STRATEGY.md](TESTING_STRATEGY.md) for comprehensive test requirements
4. **Track progress**: Use [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) to monitor implementation status
5. **Choose a phase**: Start with Phase 1 for maximum impact
6. **Pick a surface**: Each surface document contains complete implementation guidance
7. **Follow the plan**: Each surface includes API design, examples, and technical considerations

## Success Metrics

- [ ] **Feature Coverage**: 90%+ of Rust crate capabilities exposed
- [ ] **Performance**: Measurable improvements in all scenarios  
- [ ] **API Design**: Clean, idiomatic Elixir APIs (breaking changes acceptable)
- [ ] **Quality**: 95%+ test coverage with comprehensive test suite
- [ ] **Compliance**: Pass official JSON Schema test suites for all supported drafts
- [ ] **Testing**: Unit, integration, property, and performance tests for all surfaces
- [ ] **Adoption**: Community adoption of new features and positive feedback

## Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 2-3 months (essential foundation)
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 months (high-value features)
- **Phase 3**: 2-6 months (advanced features)
- **Total**: 7-13 months for complete implementation

This upgrade will establish ExJsonschema as **the definitive JSON Schema validation library for Elixir**, providing comprehensive functionality, excellent performance, and outstanding developer experience.
