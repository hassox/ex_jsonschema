## 📋 Review & Polish Tasks

### WU1: Surface Coherence Review
**Status**: 🟢 Complete  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Objective**: Ensure all surfaces are coherent and leverage Rust optimally

**Tasks**:
- [x] **WU1.1**: Review Options module - remove unused/confusing options
- [x] **WU1.2**: Validate all compilation paths use Rust library features
- [x] **WU1.3**: Check for redundant Elixir logic that Rust already handles
- [x] **WU1.4**: Ensure configuration options map correctly to Rust capabilities
- [x] **WU1.5**: Verify sensible defaults throughout the library

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ No unused or confusing options remain
- ✅ Maximum leverage of Rust crate capabilities  
- ✅ Clear, coherent API surface
- ✅ All defaults are sensible for production use

**Completed**: 
- **WU1.1**: Successfully removed 5 unused options from initial round (`include_schema_path`, `include_instance_path`, `max_reference_depth`, `allow_remote_references`, `trusted_domains`)
- **WU1.2**: Validated all compilation paths use optimal Rust library integration via `Native.compile_schema_with_options/2`
- **WU1.3**: Discovered and fixed fundamental API design flaw - removed 4 additional "aspirational" options (`ignore_unknown_formats`, `collect_annotations`, `stop_on_first_error`, `resolve_external_refs`) that were promised but completely ignored by Rust implementation
- **WU1.4**: Updated Rust implementation to only use actually supported jsonschema-rs 0.33 features (draft selection, format validation, regex engines)
- **WU1.5**: Verified all defaults are sensible and consistent (Options, Native.ValidationOptions, and Profiles all aligned)

**Total cleanup**: Removed 9 unused/broken options, streamlined from confusing 13-field Options struct to clean 4-field struct that actually works. Added external reference resolution to README TODO for future development. All 358 tests passing.

### WU2: Comprehensive Documentation Suite
**Status**: 🟢 Complete  
**Priority**: High  
**Objective**: Create complete documentation from beginner to advanced

**Tasks**:
- [x] **WU2.1**: Create "Getting Started" guide with simple examples
- [x] **WU2.2**: Write "Advanced Features" guide (profiles, caching, best practices)
- [x] **WU2.3**: Add "Streaming Validation" guide with Elixir Stream examples
- [x] **WU2.4**: Create "Performance & Production" guide with benchmarking

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Clear learning path from basic to advanced usage
- ✅ All major features documented with working examples
- ✅ Performance guidance for production deployments
- ✅ Integration patterns clearly explained

**Completed**: 
- **WU2.1 Complete**: Created comprehensive Getting Started guide with practical examples, common patterns, error handling, and gotchas section
- **WU2.2 Complete**: Created Advanced Features guide covering configuration profiles, caching concepts, and integration patterns (cleaned up prescriptive cache implementations)
- **WU2.3 Complete**: Created Streaming Validation guide with simple streaming examples (simplified from overengineered version)
- **WU2.4 Complete**: Created Performance & Production guide covering library performance characteristics only (completely rewritten to be focused, not prescriptive)
- **Additional**: Updated mix.exs ExDoc configuration; fixed incorrect process dictionary caching advice; removed all prescriptive application code patterns
- **Result**: Complete documentation suite focused on the library itself, not trying to implement users' applications. Clean, informative guides that document what ExJsonschema does without being overly prescriptive. Documentation builds without errors, all 358 tests passing.

---

### WU3: Testing Guide Enhancement  
**Status**: ⏭️ Skipped  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Objective**: ~~Strongly recommend Noop cache as default testing approach~~ 

**Rationale**: Sufficient testing guidance already exists in other guides. Additional testing guide would likely become overly prescriptive and try to implement users' test suites rather than documenting library features.

## 🧪 Testing Principles During Wrap-Up

**CRITICAL**: Maintain test integrity throughout all changes

### Core Testing Rules
1. **Always run tests after changes**: `mix test` after every modification
2. **Behavioral tests must pass**: Core functionality tests should not be changed
3. **Only adjust tests for structural changes**: If we remove a field/option, update tests accordingly
4. **No test weakening**: Don't reduce test coverage or remove important validations
5. **Fix code, not tests**: If a behavioral test fails, fix the code to make it pass
6. **Test early, test often**: Run tests before committing any task

### When Tests Can Be Modified
- ✅ **Removing unused options**: Update tests that reference removed fields
- ✅ **API cleanup**: Adjust tests for intentional API changes
- ✅ **Error message changes**: Update exact error message assertions if messages improved
- ✅ **Adding new test coverage**: Always encouraged

### When Tests Should NOT Be Modified  
- ❌ **Core validation behavior**: Schema validation should work the same
- ❌ **Public API contracts**: Existing public functions should maintain behavior
- ❌ **Error handling**: Should still handle the same error cases
- ❌ **Performance characteristics**: Should not regress

### Test Commands to Run
```bash
# Full test suite (always run this)
mix test

# With coverage (verify we maintain >95%)  
mix test --cover

# Integration tests specifically
mix test test/integration/

# Property tests (ensure no regressions)
mix test --only property
```
